Data stored in memory is stored in bytes/bits

Bytes in memory can point to other bytes in memory
 as reference to othe data.

Endianess - describes the order in which a sequence of bytes is
 stored in computer memory. Endianness can be either big or
  small, with the adjectives referring to which value is stored first.

Limited memory makes algorithm efficiency essential.

Accessing a byte/bytes is an elementary operation which is
 defined as a single unit of operational work.

Bit(binary digit): a bit is a fundamental unit of informatio in
 CS that represents a state with one of two values, 
 typically 0 and 1.

Byte(8 Bits): (ex. 01101000) a single byte can represent up to 
 256 data values 2 to power of 8(2^8 = Binary Number).
 ex. following bytes represent the number 1,2,3,4 in binary format
 1: 0000 0001
 2: 0000 0010
 3: 0000 0011
 4: 0000 0100
 5: 0000 0101
 6: 0000 0110
 7: 0000 0111
 8: 0000 1000
 9: 0000 1001
 10: 0000 1010

Fixed-Width Integer: represents a fix number of bits.
 Ex. 
 32-bit integer(4bytes) 1: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001
 64-bit integer (8 bytes)
